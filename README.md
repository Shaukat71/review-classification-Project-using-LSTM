Sentiment Analysis Using NLP This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on text data.I used The LSTM algorithm to achive the goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately identify the sentiment of a piece of text, such as whether it is positive, negative. The project uses a variety of NLP techniques to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis. These techniques include tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. The project also uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to train the sentiment analysis model. The project evaluates the performance of the sentiment analysis model on a held-out test set. The results show that the model is able to accurately identify the sentiment of text data with a high degree of accuracy. The sentiment analysis model can be used for a variety of purposes, such as: Analyzing customer feedback to identify areas of improvement Tracking public opinion on social media Identifying sentiment towards brands and products Classifying text data into different categories, such as news articles, product reviews, or social media posts Overall, the project provides a comprehensive overview of sentiment analysis using NLP. The project also develops a sentiment analysis model that can be used for a variety of purposes.
